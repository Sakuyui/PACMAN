class UnorderedCompressor(object):
    """
    Routing Table compressor based on brute force.
    Finds mergable pairs to replace.

    This algorithm assumes unordered rounting tables and returns
    unordered routing tables. It can therefor be used either as the main
    compressor or as a precompressor for another that makes use of order.

    In the simplest format the algorithm is.
    For every pair of entries in the table
        If they have the same spinnaker_route
            Create a merged entry
            Check that does not intersect any entry with a different route
                Remove the two original entries
                Add the merged entry
                Start over

    A slightly optimised algorithm is:
    Split the entries into buckets based on spinnaker route
    Process the buckets one at a time
        For each entry in the buckets
            For each other entry in the bucket
                Create a merge entry
                Make sure there is no clash with an entry in another bucket
                Replace the two entries and add the merge
                Start the bucket over
            If no merge found move the entry from the bucket to the result list
        When the bucket is empty the result list becomes the bucket

    Another optimisation is that instead of saving entries in the buckets
    Save just triples of key, mask and defaultable
        (spinneker_route is assigned at the bucket level)
    Then create entries at the end using the tuples
